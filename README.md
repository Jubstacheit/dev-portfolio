My portfolio

This repository is about the first website I want to do from A to Z : my portfolio.

This portfolio is focused on showing my skills in front-end developpment with javascript and ReactJS, and getting some visibility. This doesn't reflect all of my skills that wouldn't fit this purpose (ex. : drawings, games, etc).
I'll do a proper, bigger portfolio later for all of my works.

This repository is public so people can check my code and help me if there are some things to improve, because i'm still a junior.
