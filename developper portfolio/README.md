my portfolio

This repository is about the first website I want to do from A to Z : my portfolio which will help me to get a job and some visibility.

This portfolio is focused on showing my skills in front-end developpment with javascript and ReactJS, and getting a job. This doesn't reflect all of my skills that wouldn't fit this purpose (ex. : drawings, games, etc).
I'll do a proper, bigger portfolio later.

This repository is public so people can check my code and help me if there are some things to improve, because i'm still a junior.
